# JGMOD - MOD Music player for ALlegro 4.2.3.1

JGMOD was originally written by Jeffery Guan Foo Wah in 2002.  

JGMOD was built using Allegro and supports playback of MOD, S3M, XM, Unreal S3M (in UMX extension), and JGM files.  

This repository archives the libraries source code (as late as I could find), while also providing a prebuilt library for use with [Allegro 4.2.3.1](https://github.com/ArtificialRaccoon/allegro-4.2-xc) and [DJGPP built with GCC 12.1.0](https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp).  This prebuilt release is intended for use with the VSCode [DOS-Dev](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=badlogicgames.dos-dev) Extension.

Please see [the orginal authors readme.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArtificialRaccoon/JGMOD/main/readme.txt) for historical contact information and more.
